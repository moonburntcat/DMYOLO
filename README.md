Dataset  
A custom dataset named the Belangeri Croaker Dataset was constructed by collecting images of both infected and healthy belangeri croaker. The images were captured from the Penghu semi-submersible deep-sea cage situated in proximity to Guishan Island, China. The monitoring equipment terminal was also deployed at this location. On March 19, 2024, the underwater camera was installed at a depth of 4 meters on the cage railing, and continuous image collection of belangeri croaker was conducted over a three-week period. The fish had been cultured for five months at the time of data collection.
The dataset can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moonburntcat/belangeri-croaker-dataset/data  
It contains folders 1-5 and labels.

How to Use the Source Code  
requirements.txt: the enviroment requirements
get_FPS.py: get FPS of the model  
heatmap.py: get heapmap of the model,you can choose whatever layers of the model  
train_v10.py: set training parameters here and start training  
test.py: test the model  
The improved YAML file we have tried is located at: DMYOLO\ultralytics\cfg\models\v10
